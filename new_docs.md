# Tutorials:

- Absolute basics for beginners (remove installation, can pandas import/export be replaced
  with numpy.loadtxt?) 

      - the intro to "what is numpy" is here

      - the basic install instructions are here


- Quickstart Tutorial (meant for follow-up to [Python
  tutorial](https://docs.python.org/tutorial/) )

  
- Working with Numpy arrays 

    - array creation (np.zeros, np.ones, np.block, etc.)

    - element-wise operations (`+,-,*,/`) and linear algebra operations (`+,-,@,
      linalg.solve`)

    - How to read and write data using Numpy (high priority)

    - Indexing



# How-to's:


- Linear Algebra on n-dimensional arrays (would love to edit the headings and
  descriptions and maybe change title to "Image processing with Numpy's linear algebra")

- link to numpy-tutorials/numpy-recipes

# Explanation:

- Data types

- I/O with Numpy

- Indexing

- Broadcasting

- Byte-swapping 

- Structured arrays

- Writing custom array containers

- subclassing ndarray

- Miscellaneous 

# Reference Space:

- Numpy Cheat sheet (to start, just grab each function from tutorials and how-to's list
  them in groups with links and minimal input-output)

- Glossary 

- Numpy API Reference 

- Numpy for Matlab users (equivalence table is a great how-to reference table, but
  array/matrix discussion is distracting and seems deprecated)
