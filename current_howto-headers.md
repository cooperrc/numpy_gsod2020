# Learn to write a Numpy tutorial # Title: 
Give a descriptive title that tells readers what to expect

e.g. How to solve a linear set of equations in Numpy

# Who is the audience: 
Tell the reader who you expect to be reading the how-to

e.g. This is meant for engineers and scientists that want to use Numpy to solve a set of
linear equations. 

# What is the problem:
Define the vocabulary, background information, and the specific problem you're solving

e.g. Linear equations are typically straigthforward to define in engineering and
scientific applications, but general solution methods can be difficult to do by hand.
Numpy has a great set of tools to quickly solve linear sets of equations. 

# What you'll do: 
Give a brief overview of the approach you are documenting

e.g. You'll use numpy arrays and the numpy.linalg functions to solve a set of linear
equations

# What you'll learn:
Give a brief overview of what skills will be taught or strengthened

e.g. You'll learn to set up linear equations, define them as arrays, and get a solution
that satisfies the equations

# ~~What you'll need~~ Method of solution
Here you detail the process of the solution. What objects and functions are used to define
and then solve the problem?

e.g. In this how-to I define a set of linear equations as 2D and 1D arrays to define the
coefficients and outputs for a given set of equations. Then, I use the numpy.linalg.solve
function to solve for the unknown variables in my equations. 

# Results:
Here you walk the reader through the step-by-step process of problem definition, code
setup, and solution. 

e.g. import the libraries, define variables, solve the problem, get the solution

# Discussion:
* How do the results from numpy relate to the problem? 
* How does it solve the initial problem? 
* Are there any missing pieces or future work? Compare the result to other methods
or results

# Conclusion:
Here you describe how these skills made the problem easier to solve, or faster, or better. 

e.g. using numpy to solve linear equations in engineering and science is a way to speed up
calculations for lots of interdependent linear systems
