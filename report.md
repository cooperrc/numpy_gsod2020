# NumPy documentation for community education 

# Google's Season of Docs - Project Report

The building blocks of educational tools are communication and community
[[1]](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/852/852-h/852-h.htm).  Great
documentation needs to establish a community  that reflects the desired
goals of the project. This project had three specific aims to
communicate NumPy ideas and philosophy to the community.


##  Specific aims 

I had three specific aims for this Google Season of Docs (GSoD) project: 
1. Organize the current documentation 
2. Edit the current tutorials and move reference information into the
Explanation Space 
3. Build tutorials with students. 

Each specific aim has an outcome for from the project.  These three
specific aims made the documentation more welcoming for new users and
provided structure for potential contributors. The aims also helped to
grow the NumPy documentation community, a longer term goal. 

## Project outcomes

I had three outcomes from this Google Season of Docs project: 
1. A revised documentation
webpage that clearly separates the four spaces: tutorials, how-to, explanation, and
reference 
2. Write new tutorials and explanations 
3. Build a curated tutorial space for new contributors 
 
These outcomes help new users progress through documents,
provide potential documentation contributors with clear styles and
formats, built new tutorials that are easy to follow, moved
explanations to its own section, and new documentation contributors
will be able to contribute small use cases to the [NumPy
Tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials) without
building entire Sphinx documentation. The
teaching-and-learning community around these documents has been focused
on user involvement. 

### Outcomes overview

Since the project started, I have

- participated in 8 NumPy Documentation Community calls
- participated in 7 NumPy Development Community calls
- posted over 100 messages on the NumPy Slack channel
- opened 13 PRs with 10 closed
- opened 8 issues with 4 closed
- made 7 reviews on community PRs
- mentored 3 new NumPy users developing NumPy tutorials [UConn NumPy
  Tutorials](https://github.com/cooperrc/uconn_numpy_tutorials)
- at [NumPy tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials) made 22
  commits with 3,847 lines added and 1,426 deleted 

The activities listed above demonstrates the close connection NumPy
documentation has with community involvement. Conversations in Slack led
to tutorial ideas and documentation revisions. 

### Specific outcomes - tied to specific aims

Here, I list all of the issues and pull requests (PRs) submitted in
connection to GSoD. 

The first goal was to fork the NumPy repository and build the
documentation, which led to my first open/closed issue

- [Building Documentation in a conda environment (Arch
  Linux)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17016)

Next, I suggested we update the NumPy for MATLAB users documentation.
MATLAB was my first programming experience and I still use it regularly.
This background created a fascinating and lively discussion for updating
the document. There were a few ideas left for future work including:
building a NumPy for MATLAB users tutorial and creating a reference
document to describe some of the benefits and drawbacks of each
array-computing software. 

__issue__:
- [Need to update NumPy for Matlab users
  documentation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17094)

__PRs__:
- [DOC: Update numpy4matlab](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17159)
- [DOC: Use official MATLAB spelling in
  numpy-for-matlab-users.rst](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17215)

Next, I suggested a tutorial for saving and loading NumPy arrays. My
original idea was to demonstrate a full workflow including loading data
or building matrices, then saving the results of the analysis. The
tutorial content was divided into two tutorials for 'Saving and Loading
NumPy arrays' and 'Moore's law linear regression with real data'. 

__issue__:
- [DOC: request for tutorial saving and loading NumPy
  arrays](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17266)

__PRs__:
- [adding tutorial for creating Moore's law linear
  regression](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/31)
- [Save load arrays - Created a short tutorial to create, save, and load
  arrays using savez, savetxt, load, and
  loadtxt](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/34)


__issue__:
- [update Array Creation
  Document](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17710)
__PRs__:
- [DOC: update arraycreation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17887)


__PRs__:
- [Contribute Myst-NB with jupytext](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/48)

__issue__:
- [Update Landing page and table of contents -
  devdocs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17845)
__PRs__:
- [renamed basics to fundamentals + added
  description](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17889)
